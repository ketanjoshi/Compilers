Project 2 		: Parser and parse tree generation
-----------------------------------------------------

Zip contains the make file called "parser.make" with modes "clean", "build", "exec" and "all".

COMMAND LINE INPUTS:
If you need to pass the .pt file or .sfp file (needed only for "all" or "exec" mode)from commandline you can do so using:
make parser.make <mode> SFP_FILE=<your_sfp_name> PT_FILE=<your_pt_name>


MAKE FILE MODES:
1. clean 	- cleans the generated lex and exe files
2. build 	- builds the lex.yy.c and parser executables
3. exec 	- executed the program using .pt and .sfp files (by default it runs on input.pt and sample.sfp)
4. all 		- runs all the above modes sequentially
